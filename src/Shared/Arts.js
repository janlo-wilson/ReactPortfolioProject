The 2013 production marked the first time the classic tale born in 1957 as a TV movie starring Julie Andrews was produced on Broadway where it ran for two years. Douglas Carter Beane’s revamped book introduces new characters and surprising twists giving today’s audiences a fresh look at the tale while keeping in the elements that generations of fans of the show remember: the pumpkin, the glass slipper, the masked ball, and others. Lush orchestrations accompany the familiar songs of the original, In My Own Little Corner, Ten Minutes Ago, The Prince is Giving a Ball, among others and adds new ones from the R&H catalog. No matter one’s age, when the slipper fits, the heart will soar.",
