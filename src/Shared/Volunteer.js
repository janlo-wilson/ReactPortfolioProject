Our site captains lead their individual sites on the day of the event, and we provide the supplies, additional volunteer outreach, and site coordination. On the day of the event, site captains are the main point of contact for volunteers, pass out supplies, give a safety talk, and keep record of the trash & debris. After the event, site captains report back to I Love A Clean San Diego with their site totals.",

Camp volunteers create the opportunities for kids to laugh and be silly, while also keeping them safe, both emotionally and physically. Most of our counselors live in the cabins with kids and interact with them throughout the day in activities, meals, and downtime. Volunteers must be available for the entire week of camp, plus a one day orientation the day before camp begins. All volunteers are thoroughly screened and subject to a background check before they can attend camp.",
