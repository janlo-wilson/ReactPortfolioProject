Camp volunteers create the opportunities for kids to laugh and be silly, while also keeping them safe, both emotionally and physically. Most of our counselors live in the cabins with kids and interact with them throughout the day in activities, meals, and downtime. Volunteers must be available for the entire week of camp, plus a one day orientation the day before camp begins. All volunteers are thoroughly screened and subject to a background check before they can attend camp.",
